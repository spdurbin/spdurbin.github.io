        <h1>Didot vs. Bodoni </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Didot</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Developed by Firmin Didot from 1784–1811, described as a Neoclassical serif typeface. It became the standard in French printing as Firmin Didot’s family owned the most influential and successful print shop and font foundry in France. The font was soon sought after by royalty and associated with luxury and grandeur.  Firmin Didot was inspired by the Baskerville font with pronounced serifs and rounded letters. Didot is characterized by increased stroke contrast, hairline strokes, vertical stress, and unbracketed serifs. </p>
             
			 <h3>Bodoni</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Bodoni was designed by Giambattista Bodoni in the late 18th century, pushing a modern style rather than the traditional calligraphy that was commonly seen during this time. Giambattista Bodoni was the director of the Royal Typography in Parma, which is where the development of the typeface began. Inspired by the work of John Baskerville and French styles, this typeface is similar to Didot. The font is characterized by its thick and thin contrasts, unbracketed serifs, vertical stress, and small aperture. Bodoni was first released as a classical design, but it transitioned into being named a modern serif font. Because of the many renditions that have been done of Bodoni, the newer designs are now considered transitional rather than modern. </p>
